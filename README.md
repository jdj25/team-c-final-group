## **Building Upon Foundations**

It's time to harness the insights from your mid-term project. As you dive into this comprehensive assignment, remember the personas, customer journey, and branding concepts previously crafted. The foundations are set; now, we transition into a full-fledged web solution using advanced development techniques and agile project management. 

## Website Info Architecture / Design Requirements

1.  Homepage - Hero section with call to action and form
2.  About page
3.  Blog with 2-3 articles that reflect your brand <- Social media meta data and share links and uses mardkown like we did in the nextJS tutorial
4.  Privacy policy 

## **Assignment Goals**

- **Web Solution Integration**: Develop a web solution that integrates the theoretical knowledge and practical skills acquired throughout the course.
  
- **Technical Incorporation**: Seamlessly incorporate NextJS, Playwright, GitHub Actions, Google Analytics, and Mailchimp.

- **Web Design**: Design a Figma representation of your website.

- **Project Management**: Employ an Agile project management methodology, with a particular emphasis on Playwright for testing.

- **User Tracking**: Track user interactions and conversions, emphasizing users signing up through Mailchimp. Ensure legal and ethical data collection through GDPR compliance.

- **Team Collaboration**: Facilitate collaboration among group members, designating roles based on strengths.

## **Technical Requirements**

1. **NextJS**: The backbone of your website.
  
2. **Google Analytics & GDPR**: 
   - Monitor user behaviors, ensuring GDPR compliance when tracking metrics.
   - Create a privacy policy page to legitimize the collection of user data.
   - Prioritize understanding Google Analytics integration with NextJS under GDPR regulations. Consider designating a team member with technical proficiency for this task.

3. **Mailchimp**: 
   - Incorporate Mailchimp for email collection. 
   - Make sure the process is GDPR compliant. Mailchimp assists in acquiring email addresses legally and ensures compliance with email laws.
   - Features to harness: GDPR-friendly forms, unsubscribe links, double opt-in procedures.

4. **Playwright**: Use Playwright for testing each user story and its acceptance criteria.

5. **GitHub Actions**: Utilize previously set up GitHub actions and configurations for an efficient workflow.

6. **Figma**: Design and showcase your web interfaces.

7. **Agile Methodology**: 
   - Leverage the principles of Agile.
   - **Use GitHub projects/issues to manage user stories (at least 10 per person)** with story points and acceptance criteria.
   - Each visual user story should link back to its Figma design.
   - Compile all issues into a document with direct links for easy assessment.

8. **QA Process**: 
   - Before submission, your team should engage in a manual QA review.
   - Identify a minimum of 5 issues, resolve them, and document the process as a group activity report.

9. **Deployment**: 
   - Launch your website using Vercel or GitHub pages.
   - The repository's `readme.md` should contain links to the deployed site and presentation video.

## **User Journey**

1. **Discovery**: User discovers the site via a shared link. Ensure that social media metadata (like Twitter and Facebook) showcases your brand appropriately, complete with engaging imagery. [Reference here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIbSlwz2u5I).
  
2. **Engagement**: On arriving at the homepage, the user encounters the hero text and the primary call-to-action (CTA). This CTA interaction should be tracked as an event in Google Analytics.
  
3. **Conversion**: Upon clicking the CTA, users should be prompted to sign up with their email address. Track form submissions in Google Analytics to document the entire user conversion journey.

## **Final Presentation**

Your presentation should be a captivating journey through your project, captured in a concise 5-minute video. Address the following:

1. **Brand's Journey**: Share your brand's story, archetype, and persona.
  
2. **Website Experience**: Walk us through your site, spotlighting the user stories and their alignment with your brand and target audience.
  
3. **Tech Showcase**: Demonstrate Playwright tests, highlight GitHub Actions, and narrate a user's journey from their initial landing to Mailchimp signup.
  
4. **Data Insights**: Unveil key Google Analytics data points, illustrating user navigation patterns.
  
5. **Concluding Thoughts**: Reflect on your journey, obstacles tackled, and the knowledge gained.

Aim for a balanced presentation that not only celebrates the technical aspects but also the brand's narrative and the strategic decisions made throughout the project.
